    "    \n",
    "**Cardiovascular disease (CVD)** is the number one cause of death worldwide [1]. CVDs can refer to some conditions [2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Heart disease**\n",
    "Heart and blood vessel disease (also called heart disease) includes numerous problems, for example, a disorder of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle.\n",
    "when the inner walls of arteries become narrower due\n",
    "to a buildup of plaque (usually caused by a diet high\n",
    "in fat, cigarette smoking, diabetes or hypertension). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Heart attack**\n",
    "It occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked by a blood clot. If this clot cuts off the blood flow completely, the part of the heart muscle supplied by that artery begins to die.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Stroke**\n",
    "An _ischemic stroke_ (the most common type of stroke) occurs when a blood vessel that feeds the brain gets blocked, usually from a blood clot.<br/>\n",
    "A _hemorrhagic stroke_ occurs when a blood vessel within the brain bursts. This is most often caused by uncontrolled hypertension (**high blood pressure**).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Heart failure**\n",
    "The heart is not pumping blood as well as it should. It keeps working, but the body does not get all the blood and oxygen it needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Arrhythmia**\n",
    "Arrhythmia refers to an abnormal heart rhythm. There are various types of arrhythmias. The heart can beat too slow, too fast or irregularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Heart valve problems**\n",
    "When heart valves don‚Äôt open enough to allow the blood to flow through as it should, a condition called stenosis results. When the heart valves don‚Äôt close properly and thus allow blood to leak through, it‚Äôs called regurgitation. If the valve leaflets bulge or prolapse back into the upper chamber, it‚Äôs a condition called prolapse. <br/> <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1, 3], CDVs are responsible for an estimated _17.9 million deaths in 2019_, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke. Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as **tobacco use**, **unhealthy diet** and **_obesity_**, **physical inactivity** and **harmful use of alcohol**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important **to detect cardiovascular** disease _as early as possible_ so that management with counselling and medicines can begin. <br/><br/>\n",
